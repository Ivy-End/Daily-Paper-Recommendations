  - 摘要：Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

  - 摘要：Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

- **Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model**

  - 摘要：Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

- **Design of Backscatter Tailored Optical Fibers for distributed magnetic
  field sensing using Fiber Optic Pulsed Polarimetry**
  - 发表日期：2025-10-27 | 推荐度：0.798 | 来源：arXiv

  - 摘要：Fiber optic pulsed polarimetry is a LIDAR-like fiber sensing technique that
uses a backscatter enhanced single mode backscatter-tailored optical
fiber(BTOF) to measure the distributed B fields on all Magnetic Fusion Energy
devices. The BTOF has a series of wavelength resonant reflection fiber Bragg
gratings written uniformly along its length. The fiber's Verdet constant
determines the strength of the Faraday effect which effectuates the measurement
of local B along the fiber placed intimately next to or within a magnetized
plasma volume. A robust measurement of the field distribution along the fiber
is obtained at high rep rates, 5 MHz, high spatial resolution(1-10cm), high B
field accuracy(<1%) and temporal response (ns). Multipathing in the BTOF
produces 3rd order reflections that contaminate the LIDAR signal. Algorithms
are given for calculating the level of contamination for uniform and flat
reflection designs, in particular and any reflection series in general. The
contamination is bracketed giving confidence in designing and implementing a
BTOF. Applications include magnetic fusion devices, rail guns, high temperature
superconducting magnets and magnetized target fusion research.

- **Coherent all-optical tuning of large-area phase-gradient metasurface**

  - 摘要：Tunable active metasurfaces have become a major research focus in recent
years. Among tuning mechanisms, all-optical coherent control stands out because
it requires no material or geometric change, enabling ultrafast, low-energy,
interference-based modulation of amplitude, phase, and polarization in
ultrathin devices. However, when applied to phase-gradient metasurfaces,
coherent control has been limited to small apertures effectively confined to a
single Fresnel zone, leading to large divergence and degraded beam quality.
Here we propose and numerically validate a scalable method that enables
large-area coherent control. The key idea is to use coherent illumination to
tune the phase gradient within each Fresnel zone while a direct search
algorithm optimizes zone-by-zone parameters to meet system-level targets. Using
this principle, we demonstrate continuous tuning of a large-area metasurface
for continuous beam-steering without per-meta-atom phase actuation. The same
framework applies broadly to continuously tunable phase-gradient optics,
including varifocal metalenses, parfocal zoom metalenses, tunable axicons, and
related dynamic focusing elements.

  - 摘要：Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

- **Beyond the Trade-off Curve: Multivariate and Advanced Risk-Utility Maps
  for Evaluating Anonymized and Synthetic Data**

  - 摘要：Anonymizing microdata requires balancing the reduction of disclosure risk
with the preservation of data utility. Traditional evaluations often rely on
single measures or two-dimensional risk-utility (R-U) maps, but real-world
assessments involve multiple, often correlated, indicators of both risk and
utility. Pairwise comparisons of these measures can be inefficient and
incomplete. We therefore systematically compare six visualization approaches
for simultaneous evaluation of multiple risk and utility measures: heatmaps,
dot plots, composite scatterplots, parallel coordinate plots, radial profile
charts, and PCA-based biplots. We introduce blockwise PCA for composite
scatterplots and joint PCA for biplots that simultaneously reveal method
performance and measure interrelationships. Through systematic identification
of Pareto-optimal methods in all approaches, we demonstrate how multivariate
visualization supports a more informed selection of anonymization methods.

  - 摘要：A limitation of analog quantum simulators based on cold atoms in optical
lattices is that readout is typically limited to observables diagonal in the
charge basis, i.e., densities and density correlation functions. To overcome
this limitation, we propose experiment-friendly schemes to measure
charge-off-diagonal correlations (such as currents). Our protocols use
non-interacting dynamics for random times followed by standard quantum gas
microscope measurements to effectively measure in random bases. The main
requirement of our scheme is the ability to turn off interactions, which can be
done in many atomic species using Feshbach resonances. Importantly, our scheme
requires no local control and otherwise also exhibits modest requirements in
terms of total evolution time and number of repetitions. We numerically
demonstrate efficient estimation of bilinear correlation functions, requiring
less than $4000$ samples to measure local currents to 5% error (system-size
independent) and $\sim 10^4$ samples to simultaneously measure all non-local
correlations in 70-site systems. Due to its simplicity, our protocol is
implementable in existing platforms and thus paves the way to precision
measurements beyond particle number measurements.

- **Sheaves on Quivers via a Grothendieck Topology on the Path Category**

  - 链接：http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23580v1
  - 摘要：We construct Grothendieck topologies on the path category of a finite graph,
examining both coarse and discrete cases that offer different perspectives on
quiver representations. The coarse topology declares each vertex covered by all
incoming morphisms, giving the minimal non-trivial Grothendieck topology where
sheaves correspond to dual representations via dualization. The discrete
topology is the finest possible, forcing sheaves to be locally constant with
isomorphic restriction maps. We verify these satisfy Grothendieck's axioms,
characterize their sheaf categories, and establish functorial relationships
between them. Sheaves on the coarse site arise naturally from quiver
representations through dualization, while discrete sheaves correspond to
representations of the groupoid completion. This work suggests intermediate
topologies could capture subtler representation-theoretic phenomena.

- **Quantum Phase Classification of Rydberg Atom Systems Using
  Resource-Efficient Variational Quantum Circuits and Classical Shadows**

  - 摘要：Quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom arrays present significant
opportunities for studying many-body physics, yet distinguishing between
different ordered phases without explicit order parameters remains challenging.
We present a resource-efficient quantum machine learning approach combining
classical shadow tomography with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for binary
phase classification of Z2 and Z3 ordered phases. Our pipeline processes 500
randomized measurements per 51-atom chain state, reconstructs shadow operators,
performs PCA dimensionality reduction (514 features), and encodes features
using angle embedding onto a 2-qubit parameterized circuit. The circuit employs
RY-RZ angle encoding, strong entanglement via all-to-all CZ gates, and a
minimal 2-parameter ansatz achieving depth 7. Training via simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) with hinge loss converged in 120
iterations. The model achieved 100% test accuracy with perfect precision,
recall, and F1 scores, demonstrating that minimal quantum resources suffice for
high-accuracy phase classification. This work establishes pathways for
quantum-enhanced condensed matter physics on near-term quantum devices.

- **Reduced AI Acceptance After the Generative AI Boom: Evidence From a
  Two-Wave Survey Study**

  - 摘要：The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

- **Towards Deep Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks**
  - 发表日期：2025-10-27 | 推荐度：0.786 | 来源：arXiv
  - DOI：
  - 链接：http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23501v1
  - 摘要：Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

- **An Error-Based Safety Buffer for Safe Adaptive Control (Extended
  Version)**

  - 摘要：We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback
linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are
accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety
considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier
functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability,
ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric
uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the
parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is
assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing
stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective
are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on
the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all
of the theoretical developments.

  - 摘要：Calibration has emerged as a foundational goal in ``trustworthy machine
learning'', in part because of its strong decision theoretic semantics.
Independent of the underlying distribution, and independent of the decision
maker's utility function, calibration promises that amongst all policies
mapping predictions to actions, the uniformly best policy is the one that
``trusts the predictions'' and acts as if they were correct. But this is true
only of \emph{fully calibrated} forecasts, which are tractable to guarantee
only for very low dimensional prediction problems. For higher dimensional
prediction problems (e.g. when outcomes are multiclass), weaker forms of
calibration have been studied that lack these decision theoretic properties. In
this paper we study how a conservative decision maker should map predictions
endowed with these weaker (``partial'') calibration guarantees to actions, in a
way that is robust in a minimax sense: i.e. to maximize their expected utility
in the worst case over distributions consistent with the calibration
guarantees. We characterize their minimax optimal decision rule via a duality
argument, and show that surprisingly, ``trusting the predictions and acting
accordingly'' is recovered in this minimax sense by \emph{decision calibration}
(and any strictly stronger notion of calibration), a substantially weaker and
more tractable condition than full calibration. For calibration guarantees that
fall short of decision calibration, the minimax optimal decision rule is still
efficiently computable, and we provide an empirical evaluation of a natural one
that applies to any regression model solved to optimize squared error.

- **Minimizing Human Intervention in Online Classification**
  - 发表日期：2025-10-27 | 推荐度：0.781 | 来源：arXiv
  - DOI：
  - 链接：http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23557v1
  - 摘要：We introduce and study an online problem arising in question answering
systems. In this problem, an agent must sequentially classify user-submitted
queries represented by $d$-dimensional embeddings drawn i.i.d. from an unknown
distribution. The agent may consult a costly human expert for the correct
label, or guess on her own without receiving feedback. The goal is to minimize
regret against an oracle with free expert access. When the time horizon $T$ is
at least exponential in the embedding dimension $d$, one can learn the geometry
of the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based
Classifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and
calls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls. CHC attains
$\mathcal{O}(\log^d T)$ regret in $T$ and is minimax optimal for $d=1$.
Otherwise, the geometry cannot be reliably learned without additional
distributional assumptions. We show that when the queries are drawn from a
subgaussian mixture, for $T \le e^d$, a Center-based Classifier (CC) achieves
regret proportional to $N\log{N}$ where $N$ is the number of labels. To bridge
these regimes, we introduce the Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC), a
practical extension of CHC that allows for more aggressive guessing via a
tunable threshold parameter. Our approach is validated with experiments,
notably on real-world question-answering datasets using embeddings derived from
state-of-the-art large language models.

- **Separation of gain fluctuations and continuum signals in total power
  spectrometers with application to COMAP**
  - 发表日期：2025-10-27 | 推荐度：0.779 | 来源：arXiv
  - DOI：
  - 链接：http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23502v1
  - 摘要：We describe a time-domain technique for separating $1/f$ gain fluctuations
and continuum signal for a total power spectrometer, such as the CO Mapping
Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder instrument. The $1/f$ gain fluctuations of
such a system are expected to be common-mode across frequency channels. If the
instrument's system temperature is not constant across channels, a continuum
signal will exhibit a frequency dependence different from that of common-mode
gain fluctuations. Our technique leverages this difference to fit a
three-parameter frequency model to each time sample in the time-domain data,
separating gain and continuum. We show that this technique can be applied to
the COMAP Pathfinder instrument, which exhibits a series of temporally stable
resonant noise spikes that effectively act as calibrators, breaking the gain
degeneracy with continuum signals. Using both simulations and observations of
Jupiter, we explore the effect of a $1/f$ prior for the gain model. We show
that the model is capable of cleanly separating Jupiter, a bright continuum
source, from the gain fluctuations in the scan. The technique has two
applications to COMAP. For the COMAP observations performing line intensity
mapping (LIM), the technique better suppresses atmospheric fluctuations and
foregrounds than the COMAP LIM pipeline. For the Galactic COMAP observations,
which map Galactic continuum signals, the technique can suppress $1/f$ gain
fluctuations while retaining all continuum signals. This is demonstrated by the
latest COMAP observations of $\lambda$-Orionis, where our method produces far
cleaner maps than a destriper alone, typically reducing the noise power by a
factor of 7 on beam scales and up to 15 on larger scales.

- **High-Speed Imagery Analysis of Droplet Impact on Van der Waals and
  Non-Van der Waals Soft-Textured Oil-Infused Surfaces**

  - 链接：http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23516v1
  - 摘要：This study investigates the impact of surface functionalization, oil coating,
and oil absorption on droplet impact behavior on textured
polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) substrates. The textured surfaces were fabricated
with square micro-posts having spacings of 5 and 20 microns. The PDMS samples
were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to improve water
repellency. Following, the surfaces were either coated with or allowed to
absorb two different lubricants, silicone oil (SO-5cSt) and hexadecane. We
performed detailed wetting measurements on both untreated and
OTS-functionalized substrates. These measurements provided useful insights into
how water and lubricants were retained and distributed under static conditions.
High-speed imaging was used to capture droplet impact across a range of Weber
numbers. On SO-5cSt-absorbed substrates, droplets consistently showed complete
rebound at all Weber numbers, regardless of post spacing. This robust rebound
was attributed to the oil's ability to fill the gaps between the posts through
capillary action, while also forming a stable lubricating layer above the
texture. This thin oil film reduced friction between the droplet and the
surface, enabling the droplet to retain sufficient energy for complete rebound.
In contrast, hexadecane-absorbed substrates displayed different dynamics. At
low Weber numbers, only partial rebound was observed, while at intermediate
values, droplets rebounded completely. However, droplets no longer rebounded at
higher Weber numbers and remained deposited. Repeated droplet impacts further
demonstrated that hexadecane-infused surfaces gradually lost oil from the
textured gaps, resulting in a decline in rebound performance over time. This
effect was not observed with SO-5cSt, underscoring the importance of lubricant
affinity and stability.

  dispersion**

  - DOI：
  - 链接：http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23556v1
  - 摘要：In this work, we develop a potential-based formalism for Maxwell's equations
in isotropic media with weak spatial dispersion within the electric
quadrupole-magnetic dipole approximation. We introduce an operator form of the
constitutive relations along with a modified Lorenz gauge condition, which
enables the derivation of decoupled generalized wave equations for
electromagnetic potentials. For time-harmonic processes, we derive the
representation of general solution for these equations as a combination of
solutions to Helmholtz-type equations, whose parameters are determined by both
standard and hyper-susceptibilities of the medium. We show that the proposed
approach can be extended to more general constitutive relations and it provides
a convenient framework for solving various applied problems. Specifically,
using a derived closed-form solution for the problem of plane wave incidence on
a planar interface, we demonstrate that a correct definition of the Poynting
vector within the multipole theory must incorporate quadrupole effects -- an
aspect overlooked in some previous works that has led to inconsistent results.
We further establish the necessity of accounting for both propagated and
evanescent longitudinal components in reflected and transmitted waves. The
presence of these components, which follow directly from the general solution
for electromagnetic potentials, is essential for satisfying all classical and
additional boundary conditions in media with quadrupolar response (e.g., in
metamaterials or quadrupolar liquid mixtures). The complete set of these
boundary conditions is derived based on the least action principle, ensuring
variational consistency with the field equations and generalizing previously
known formulations of multipole theory.

- **Classifying strict discrete opfibrations with lax morphisms**

  - 摘要：We study how discrete opfibration classifiers in a(n enhanced) 2-category can
be endowed with the structure of a $T$-algebra and thereby lift to the enhanced
2-category of 2-algebras and lax morphisms. To support this study, we give a
definition of discrete opfibration classifier in the enhanced setting in which
tight (e.g. strict) discrete opfibrations are classified by loose (e.g. lax)
maps.
  We then single out conditions on the 2-monad $T$ and the classifier that make
this possible, and observe these hold in a wide range of examples: double
categories (recovering the results of Par\`e and Lambert), (symmetric) monoidal
categories, and all structures encoded by familial 2-monads. We also prove the
properties needed on such 2-monads are stable under replacement by
pseudo-algebra coclassifiers (when sufficient exactness conditions hold),
allowing us to replace a pseudo-algebra structure on the classifier by a strict
one.
  To get to our main theorem, we introduce the concepts of \emph{cartesian
maps} and \emph{cartesian objects} of a 2-algebra, which generalize various
other notions in category theory such as cartesian monoidal categories,
extensive categories, categories with descent, and more. As a corollary, we
characterize when representable copresheaves are pseudo rather than lax in
terms of the cartesianity at their representing object.

  Riemannian manifolds**

  - 摘要：We consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary with a certain class
of critical singular Riemannian metrics that are singular at the boundary. The
corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator can be seen as a Grushin-type operator
plus a potential. We show in the critical case that the average density of
eigenfunctions for the Laplace-Beltrami operator with eigenvalues below
$\lambda>0$ is distributed over all length scales between $\lambda^{-1/2}$ and
$1$ near the boundary. We give a precise description of this distribution as
$\lambda\to\infty$.

  - 摘要：The Terwilliger algebras of association schemes over an arbitrary field
$\mathbb{F}$ were called the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of association
schemes in [9]. In this paper, we study the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras
of factorial association schemes. We determine the centers, the semisimplicity,
the Jacobson radicals and their nilpotent indices, the Wedderburn-Artin
decompositions of the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of factorial
association schemes. Moreover, we determine all Terwilliger
$\mathbb{F}$-algebras of factorial association schemes that are the symmetric
$\mathbb{F}$-algebras or the Frobenius $\mathbb{F}$-algebras.

  - 摘要：We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different
stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We
employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius
of the $\alpha$-accretion disc ($<0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the
interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the
self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of
stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively,
producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included,
fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding
the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the
ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both
radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent:
it survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being
replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes
place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling
the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH
growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with
IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy
models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with
future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA,
and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift
supermassive BHs observed by JWST.

  - 摘要：Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain
parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such
as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer
additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and
power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To
address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the
bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level
bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field
theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on
synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the
transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the
bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian
smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the
statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum
prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k <= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the
cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use
a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew
spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally
applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field
in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and
line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory
prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced)
field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function
making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.

  Pairing, and Pseudogap**

  - 摘要：Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of
heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a
periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals.
This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential,
pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the
single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$,
$J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S>J_D$) or a valley doublet
($J_D>J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and
analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using
bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley
doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in
sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there
is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi
liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law
susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when
$J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from
Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an
intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet
(local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes
attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we
construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation
self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in
recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a
non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the
anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG
calculations.

  - 摘要：This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of
discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in
the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and
sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms
of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation
for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its
analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the
densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a
special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time
distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of
Gorin-Shkolnikov. Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature
limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by
Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102;
arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in
[J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we
prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high
temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint
intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of
explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also
show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi
operators.
